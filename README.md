Welcome to the Unity Real-time Multiplayer Alpha repository!

Here you can find all the resources you need to start prototyping
your own real-time multiplayer games.

## Included content

- `sampleproject/` - Unity Project containing all the multiplayer samples.
- `sampleproject/Assets/Samples/Asteroids` - Asteroids clone demonstrating the core netcode concepts.
- `sampleproject/Assets/Samples/LagCompensation` - Sample showing lag compensation based on Unity Physics.
- `sampleproject/Assets/Samples/NetCube` - Sample showing basic netcode usage.
- `sampleproject/Assets/Samples/Ping` - Sample showing basic transport usage.
- `sampleproject/Assets/Samples/Soaker` - A soak tester for the transport, for testing typical production load.

### Unity Transport Package
The new Unity Transport Package which will replace the UNet low-level API.
The preview of the transport package supports establishing connections and sending messages to a
remote host. It also contains utilities for serializing data streams to send
over the network.
For more information about the transport package, please see the [Unity Transport Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.transport@latest)

### Unity NetCode Package
The netcode package provides the multiplayer features needed to implement
world synchronization in a multiplayer game. It uses the transport package
for the socket level functionality and is made for the [Entity Component System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest).
Some higher level things it provides are
* Server authoritative synchronization model.
* RPC support, useful for control flow or network events.
* Client / server world bootstrapping so you have clear separation of logic and you can run a server with multiple clients in a single process, like the editor when testing.
* Synchronize entities with interpolation and client side prediction working by default.
* Network traffic debugging tools
* GameObject conversion flow support, so you can use a hybrid model to add multiplayer to a GameObject/MonoBehaviour based project.

### Samples

#### Ping
The ping sample is a good starting point for learning about all the parts included
in the transport package. The ping client establishes a connection to the ping server,
sends a ping message and receives a pong reply. Once pong is received the client
will disconnect.
It is a simple example showing you how to use the new Unity Transport Package.
Ping consists of multiple scenes, all found in `sampleproject/Assets/Scenes/` .
- `PingMainThread.unity` - A main-thread only implementation of ping.
- `Ping.unity` - A fully jobified version of the ping client and server.
- `PingClient.unity` - The same jobified client code as `Ping.unity`, but without the server.
- `PingServer.unity` - The dedicated server version of the jobified ping. A headless (or Server Build in 2019.1) Linux 64 bit build of this scene is what should be deployed to Multiplay.
- `PingECS.unity` - An ECS version of the jobified ping sample.

#### Soaker
A stress test which will create a set number of clients and a server in the same process. Each client will send messages at the specified rate with the specified size and measure statistics.

#### Asteroids
A small game featuring the Unity NetCode Package features.

#### LagCompensation
A sample showing a way to implement lag compensation based on Unity Physics. In a game based on the Unity NetCode the client will display an old world state, lag compensation allows the server to take this into account when performing raycasts so the player can aim at what is actually displayed on the client.

#### NetCube
A small sample featuring the Unity NetCode Package features. This is the code used in the [Unite presentation about NetCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_-FoJuaYOI)

## Installation

To try out samples in this repository all you need to do is open
`sampleprojects/` in Unity.
If you wish to create a new Unity project using these packages that is
also possible.
* Make sure you have a supported version of Unity (2019.3 or newer)
* Create a new Unity project
* If you want to use the NetCode, add `Unity NetCode` from the package manager.
* If you want to use the transport but not NetCode, add `Unity Transport` from the package manager.
* Package dependencies will automatically be pulled into the project
